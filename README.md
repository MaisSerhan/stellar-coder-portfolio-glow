# 💻 Welcome to My Experience with the Lovable Website

I decided to try out [Lovable](https://lovable.dev), a platform that generates ready-made websites using simple prompts.

To start, I gave it a very basic command:  
> *"Create a portfolio for a girl who works in computer systems engineering."*

The platform quickly generated a site, but I noticed it didn’t include my name or many of the important details I had in mind. Then, I hit a limit — the free version ran out of credits, and I couldn’t give it any more commands.

That’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands and customize the generated site myself.

Even though I wasn’t familiar with **TypeScript**, the main language used in the project, I explored the code, did my research, and gradually learned how to make the changes I wanted. 

This experience showed me something important:  
> **Programming is more about understanding principles than just knowing syntax.**

Once you have an idea and a goal, you can build and adapt. That’s what engineering teaches us — how to approach new tools, solve unfamiliar problems, and keep learning along the way.
